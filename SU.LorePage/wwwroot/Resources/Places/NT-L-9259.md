[color=sys][speed=0]--- BEGIN ---[speed=default][color=white]
NT-L-9259 is a research facility located in Sector [color=red]{MISSING ACCESS}[color=white]. Around the [color=red]{MISSING ACCESS}[color=white] nebula, deep within NanoTrasen space.
The facility was established in 2159 and has been operational since. 
It was established after the discovery of the [color=red]{MISSING ACCESS}[color=white] strain in the slime population on [color=red]{MISSING ACCESS}[color=white]. It has been a key player in the research and development of the [color=red]{MISSING ACCESS}[color=white] and in the development of the [color=red]{MISSING ACCESS}[color=white] weapon.

The facility is currently operational and is under the command of [color=red]{MISSING ACCESS}[color=white].
Due to the nature of the research being conducted, the facility is under strict security protocols and is not open to the public.
NT-L-9259 used to consist of 5 stations around planet [color=red]{MISSING ACCESS}[color=white], but due to the [color=red]{MISSING ACCESS}[color=white] incident, only 1 station remains.
