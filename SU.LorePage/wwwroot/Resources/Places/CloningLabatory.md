History & Description

[color=sys][speed=0]--- BEGIN ---[speed=default][color=white]
The Andromeda Cloning Facility, designated NT-CF-Andromeda, was established in [color=red]{MISSING ACCESS}[color=white] as part of NanoTrasen's expansion into extragalactic territories. Its primary mission is to support the burgeoning populations of colonies and research stations throughout the sector by providing advanced cloning services. This facility is renowned for its cutting-edge technology in rapid clone development and memory imprinting, ensuring that each clone is a perfect replica of the original subject. Located at coordinates [color=red]{MISSING ACCESS}[color=white], NT-CF-Andromeda stands as a testament to NTs ingenuity and the endless pursuit of scientific advancement.

[color=sys]Cloning Overview[color=white]

[color=sys]Purpose of the Cloning Bay[color=white]
The Cloning Bay within the Central Command complex is dedicated to creating and storing clones until they are needed elsewhere.

[color=sys]Current Clone Count:[color=white]            2,000 clones awaiting assignment.
[color=sys]Cost per Clone:[color=white]                 [color=red]{MISSING ACCESS}[color=white]
[color=sys]Growth Time:[color=white]                    3 years to fully grow.
[color=sys]Genetics:[color=white]                       Clones are genetically identical to their donors, encompassing a wide range of species.

[color=sys]Cloning Process[color=white]
Clones are produced by extracting stem cells from a donor's skin, which are then grown into complete bodies. These bodies are kept in tanks filled with a nutrient solution, alive but dormant, until activated and sent to their destination via graviton projectors.

[color=sys]Location:[color=white]                       [color=red]{MISSING ACCESS}[color=white]
[color=sys]Facility Features:[color=white]              Large tanks for clones;
                                Extensive support equipment;
                                Massive central tank over 10 meters high.

[color=sys]Relevance to Gameplay[color=white]
If a character dies on-station and is not revived by the end of the shift, cloning at Central Command is how they can return in future sessions.

[color=sys]Mechanics of Cloning[color=white]
       
[color=sys]Soul Presence:[color=white]                  The soul must be present and willing to inhabit the new body, relinquishing control of its previous body.
[color=sys]Soul Refusal:[color=white]                   A soul can refuse entry, leaving the clone a husk.
[color=sys]Body or Brain Presence:[color=white]         Having the old body or brain present can expedite the soul transfer process.
[color=sys]Soul Uniqueness:[color=white]                No two instances of the same character can exist simultaneously due to the uniqueness of the soul.
[color=sys]Soul Dissipation:[color=white]               A soul without a body can dissipate if not determined to remain.
[color=sys]Memory Accumulation:[color=white]            A disembodied soul does not accumulate memories.
[color=sys]Personal Imprint Requirement:[color=white]   NanoTrasen requires a valid Personal Imprint for cloning, which includes DNA and memory imprints.

[color=sys]NanoTrasen Cloning Bank (NT CB)[color=white]
The NT CB is tasked with cloning employees, with direct access to NT DNA databanks and sufficient biomass resources. Cloning incurs a significant cost, deducted from the employee's next paycheck, making it a discouraged option unless necessary.

[color=sys]Facility Designation:[color=white]           Large facility for employee cloning.
[color=sys]Access to DNA Databanks:[color=white]        Assumed direct access.
[color=sys]Cost:[color=white]                           [color=red]{MISSING ACCESS}[color=white],
                                deducted from the clone's next paycheck.
[color=sys]Policy:[color=white]                         Cloning is generally discouraged due to its cost and implications.

Incident Reports

[color=sys][speed=0]--- BEGIN ---[speed=default][color=white]

No major incidents to report.
Despite the complex nature of cloning technology and the inherent risks involved, NT-CF-Andromeda has maintained a remarkable safety record since its inception. Rigorous protocols, advanced security measures, and the dedication of our highly skilled staff have ensured the facility operates smoothly without significant issues.
