Commander Mildred Inspection Notes.

-Understaffing in service department seemingly unaddressed.
-Apparent skeleton that was killed. Culprit behind calls to Centcomm unauthorised.
-Red Phone stolen from HoS' office after a break in.
Understaffing in security left this unnoticed for a while.

-Whilst understaffing in service is a valid drawback experienced by this station, such messes are on a level extreme enough that a lack of intervention on the part of the crew is suprising.

Department Notes:

Science

-Scientific progress goes swimmingly. Department is clean and well organised.

Cargo

- extremely large amount of progress in spite of lack of staffing in Salvage. Huge surpluses of basic materials and a large amount of station funds.

Engineering

-Haphazard repairs made. Not up to the standard prior to sustained station damage.

Service

-Noteable lack of food provided for moth clientele
-Shotgun was unguarded on the counter. Dangerous

Security

- Messy, as was the case with most departments aside from Cargo and Science. Noteably, howver, Perma was in an uninhabitable state.
