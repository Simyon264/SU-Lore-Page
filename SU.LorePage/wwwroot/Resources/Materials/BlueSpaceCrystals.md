[color=sys]Summary[color=white]

Blue Space Crystals, often reffered to as BSC, are a rare and valuable resource used in the production of AI cores and other electronic components.
The crystals act as a catalyst in blue space reactions, allowing teleportation and communication over vast distances.
Found exclusively in the deepest reaches of space, these crystals are a key resource for NanoTrasen and are heavily guarded.

[color=sys]Discovery and Origin[color=white]

The discovery of BSCs dates back to the early 22nd century, when a NanoTrasen research vessel stumbled upon a small asteroid field in the outer reaches of the galaxy. 
The asteroid field was found to be rich in BSCs, and the discovery was kept a secret for years, as NanoTrasen worked to secure the area and establish mining operations.

The exact origin of BSCs is unkown. Some theories propose that they are remnants of ancient cosmic events, perhaps formed during the violent birth of galaxies or the cataclysmic death of massive stars. 
Others suggest a more exotic origin, hinting at the involvement of phenomena such as wormholes or the mysterious blue space itself.

[color=sys]Physical Characteristics[color=white]

BSCs are small, translucent crystals, with a distinct blue hue. They are highly resistant to damage and decay, and are known to emit a faint blue glow when exposed to certain types of radiation.
Under certain lighting conditions, they exhibit a subtle iridescence, casting shimmering reflections reminiscent of distant nebulae.

No matter the form or size, BSCs are exceptionally hard and resilient, surpassing even the most durable of known materials. 
They are also highly resistant to temperature extremes, and are known to withstand the harsh conditions of space without any signs of degradation.

[color=sys]Unique Properties and Uses[color=white]

1. Energy Amplification: BSCs are known to amplify and stabilize energy fields, making them ideal for use in the construction electronic components.
2. Navigational Aids: BSCs are sensitive to cosmic energy fields and can be used as a navigational aid in deep space, allowing for more accurate and efficient travel.
3. Blue Space Communication: BSCs are a key component in the construction of blue space communication arrays, allowing for near-instantaneous communication over vast distances.

[color=sys]Security and Handling[color=white]

Due to their rarity and value, BSCs are heavily guarded and are only handled by trained professionals.
The mining and processing of BSCs is a highly regulated process, and is only carried out by NanoTrasen personnel with the highest security clearance.
Due to the unique properties of BSCs, they are also highly sought after by various criminal organizations and rival corporations, making them a prime target for theft and sabotage.
